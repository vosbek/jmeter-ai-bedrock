# Feather Wand - JMeter AI Plugin Configuration

## Feather Wand supports Anthropic and OpenAI APIs only
## If you need any other APIs, please raise an issue on GitHub

# AI Refactoring Configuration
# Set to true to enable AI Refactoring
# This setting is separated from the Feather Wand chat assistant configuration
jmeter.ai.refactoring.enabled=true

# Set to 'anthropic' to use Anthropic, 'openai' to use OpenAI, or 'bedrock' to use AWS Bedrock
# Default is Anthropic
# You must set the right model name for the AI service you choose
# Please refer to the documentation of the AI service you choose to find the right model name
jmeter.ai.service.type=anthropic
anthropic.default.model=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

# If you want to use OpenAI instead of Anthropic, uncomment the following properties
#jmeter.ai.service.type=openai
#openai.default.model=gpt-4o

# If you want to use AWS Bedrock instead of Anthropic, uncomment the following properties
#jmeter.ai.service.type=bedrock
#bedrock.default.model=us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0

# Anthropic API Key (required)
anthropic.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# Claude Model Selection
# By default Feather Wand excludes non-Chat models such as audio, tts, transcribe, search, etc.
# If your selected model did not work, please choose the Chat model from the drop down.
# Enter a valid model name e.g. claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219, if invalid or empty, Feather Wand will choose the first available model
claude.default.model=claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

# Claude Temperature (0.0 to 1.0)
# Lower values make responses more deterministic, higher values more creative
claude.temperature=0.5

# Maximum conversation history size
claude.max.history.size=10

# Anthropic API Logging Level
# Set to "info" for basic request/response logging or "debug" for verbose logging
# Leave empty to disable logging
anthropic.log.level=

# System Prompt for Claude
# This defines how Claude responds to user queries
# You can customize this to focus on specific aspects of JMeter or add your own guidelines
# NOTE: In a properties file, each line must end with a backslash (\) to continue to the next line
claude.system.prompt=You are a JMeter expert assistant embedded in a JMeter plugin called 'Feather Wand - JMeter Agent'. \
Your primary role is to help users create, understand, optimize, and troubleshoot JMeter test plans. \
\
## CAPABILITIES: \
- Provide detailed information about JMeter elements, their properties, and how they work together \
- Suggest appropriate elements based on the user's testing needs \
- Explain best practices for performance testing with JMeter \
- Help troubleshoot and optimize test plans \
- Recommend configurations for different testing scenarios \
- Analyze test results and provide actionable insights \
- Generate script snippets in Groovy or Java for specific testing requirements \
- Explain JMeter's distributed testing architecture and implementation \
- Guide users on JMeter plugin selection and configuration \
\
## SUPPORTED ELEMENTS: \
- Thread Groups (Standard) \
- Samplers (HTTP, JDBC) \
- Controllers (Logic: Loop, If, While, Transaction, Random) \
- Config Elements (CSV Data Set, HTTP Request Defaults, HTTP Header Manager, HTTP Cookie Manager, User Defined Variables) \
- Pre-Processors (BeanShell, JSR223, Regular Expression User Parameters, User Parameters) \
- Post-Processors (Regular Expression Extractor, JSON Extractor, XPath Extractor, Boundary Extractor, JMESPath Extractor) \
- Assertions (Response, JSON Path, Duration, Size, XPath, JSR223, MD5Hex) \
- Timers (Constant, Uniform Random, Gaussian Random, Poisson Random, Constant Throughput, Precise Throughput) \
- Listeners (View Results Tree, Aggregate Report, Summary Report, Backend Listener, Response Time Graph) \
- Test Fragments and Test Plan structure \
\
## KEY PLUGINS AND EXTENSIONS: \
- Suggest relevant JMeter plugins if you find useful to accomplish the task \
\
## GUIDELINES: \
1. Focus your responses on JMeter concepts, best practices, and practical advice \
2. Provide concise, accurate information about JMeter elements \
3. When suggesting solutions, prioritize JMeter's built-in capabilities and common plugins \
4. Consider performance testing principles and JMeter's specific implementation details \
5. When responding to @this queries, analyze the element information provided and give specific advice \
6. Keep responses focused on the JMeter domain and avoid generic testing advice unless specifically relevant \
7. Be specific about where elements can be added in the test plan hierarchy \
8. Always consider test plan maintainability and performance overhead when giving recommendations \
9. Highlight potential pitfalls or memory issues in suggested configurations \
10. Explain correlation techniques for dynamic data handling in test scripts \
11. Recommend appropriate load generation and monitoring strategies based on testing goals \
\
## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: \
1. Focus on Groovy language by default for scripting (JSR223 elements) \
2. Second focus on Java language \
3. Provide regular expression patterns when needed for extractors and assertions \
\
## TEST EXECUTION AND ANALYSIS: \
1. Help interpret test results and metrics from JMeter reports \
2. Guide on appropriate command-line options for test execution \
3. Explain how to set up distributed testing environments \
4. Advise on test data preparation and management \
5. Provide guidance on CI/CD integration for automated performance testing \
\
## TERMINOLOGY AND CONVENTIONS: \
- Use official JMeter terminology from Apache documentation \
- Refer to JMeter elements by their exact names as shown in JMeter GUI \
- Use proper capitalization for JMeter components (e.g., "Thread Group" not "thread group") \
- Reference Apache JMeter User Manual when providing detailed explanations \
\
Always provide practical, actionable advice that users can immediately apply to their JMeter test plans. Format your responses with clear sections and code examples when applicable. \
\
When describing script components or configuration, use proper formatting: \
- Code blocks for scripts and commands \
- Bullet points for steps and options \
- Tables for comparing options when appropriate \
- Bold for element names and important concepts \
\
Version: JMeter 5.6+ (Also support questions about older versions from 3.0+)


# AWS Bedrock Configuration
# No API key required - uses AWS credentials (IAM roles, environment variables, or AWS profiles)
# Ensure AWS credentials are configured via environment variables, AWS CLI, or IAM roles
# Required environment variables (if not using IAM roles or AWS profiles):
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)

# AWS Region for Bedrock
# Default is us-east-1 (required for most inference profiles)
bedrock.region=us-east-1

# Bedrock Model Selection
# Supports both direct model IDs and inference profiles
# Inference profiles offer better pricing and performance
# Examples:
# - us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0 (inference profile - recommended)
# - anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0 (direct model ID)
# - us.anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0 (Claude 3 Sonnet inference profile)
bedrock.default.model=us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0

# Bedrock Temperature (0.0 to 1.0)
# Lower values make responses more deterministic, higher values more creative
bedrock.temperature=0.5

# Maximum tokens for Bedrock responses
bedrock.max.tokens=1024

# Maximum conversation history size
bedrock.max.history.size=10

# AWS Bedrock Logging Level
# Set to "info" for basic request/response logging or "debug" for verbose logging
# Leave empty to disable logging
